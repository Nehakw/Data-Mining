# Data-Mining
This section includes all the Assignments and Project work during my master's course of Data Mining
1. In the 1st homework assignment I analyzed OneR, DecisionStump, Decision Table, C4.5, PART, Linear Regression, M5P,
algorithms on Zoo Dataset
2. In the 2nd homework assignment Instance Based Learners (IBK with 1NN, 2NN and 3NN) on LED dataset. Also, I ran series of
experiement on Glass dataset by using IBK with 1NN, 2NN, 3NN and C4.5 classifiers
3. In 3rd homework assignment I tested Tree classifiers such as ID3, PRISM, JRIP on Weather, Vote and Soybean datasets
